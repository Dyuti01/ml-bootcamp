Features: - 
•	Linear Regression: 
In this algorithm, we basically use a linear function to estimate our output, say we draw a straight line though the training data sets and this straight is drawn in such a way that if we give any new feature or input to it, then we are supposed to have a good estimated output from that straight line. 

•	Logistic Regression: 
In this algorithm, we are using the mathematical sigmoid function in order to classify the sets of data into categories by learning from the training sets, and able to classify a new input unknown.

•	k-Nearest Neighbours: 
Algorithm that, given an input, chooses the most common class out of the k nearest datapoints to that point.

•	n-layer Neural Networks: 
Artificial network with an input layer, an output layer and atleast one hidden layer in between.
