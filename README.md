# Machine Learning Algorithm Library

Description: Building Machine Learning Algorithm Library.
Implemented Linear (and Polynomial) Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN and an n-layer Neural Networks from scratch.

# Features:
•	Linear Regression: 
In this algorithm, we basically use a linear function to estimate our output, say we draw a straight line though the training data sets and this straight is drawn in such a way that if we give any new feature or input to it, then we are supposed to have a good estimated output from that straight line. 

•	Logistic Regression: 
In this algorithm, we are using the mathematical sigmoid function in order to classify the sets of data into categories by learning from the training sets, and able to classify a new input unknown.

•	k-Nearest Neighbours: 
Algorithm that, given an input, chooses the most common class out of the k nearest datapoints to that point.

•	n-layer Neural Networks: 
Artificial network with an input layer, an output layer and atleast one hidden layer in between.

# Used Softwares:
Python 3.11

# About
---> In this library the above features are implemented from scratch in python without use of any mchine learning library.

---> The library file created is ml_ai1.py

---> There are .ipynb files are for each algorithm for its training and testing.

---> In each of the .ipynb files, the ml_ai1.py file is used as library.

---> We can use those .ipynb files to train our data and to save the outputs in a .csv file.

---> The outputs on test data are stored on the respective .csv files.
